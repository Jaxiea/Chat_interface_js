First step is to build up the skeletons of sending and receiving messages.

The asychronous problem needs to be solved otherwise messages won't show up at the right time.

(But maybe a refresh button should also be in place.)





Displaying the messages:

1. Parse timestamp. (check)
2. Show HTML encoding properly. (Why does "o'm" turn into "o&amp;lsquo;m"?)


Fleshing out features:

1. message entry box and submit button (or enter)
  1. get rid of errors with "'" ...
2. async/await?

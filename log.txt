First step is to build up the skeletons of sending and receiving messages.

The asychronous problem needs to be solved otherwise messages won't show up at the right time.

(But maybe a refresh button should also be in place.)





Displaying the messages:

1. Parse timestamp. (check)
2. Show HTML encoding properly. (Why does "o'm" turn into "o&amp;lsquo;m"?)


Fleshing out features:

1. message entry box and submit button (or enter) (check)
  1. get rid of errors with "'" ...  (check)
2. Simple prompt for user name before proceeding to chat. (Check)
3. Implement updateMessage() correctly. 


Styling:
Style everything.



Goals unreached:

How to implement async/await correctly to refresh message screen after message submit? (circumvented due to time constraints, refresh button added.)
Only refresh parts of chat history, not all.
